In support of the ongoing protests against systematic and institutionalized racism, in particular, the #ShutdownAcademia and #ShutdownSTEM efforts that is taking place on June 10th, we have decided to postpone the [reproducibility symposium](/events/reprod-symposium20). 

We will be announcing new dates soon.
