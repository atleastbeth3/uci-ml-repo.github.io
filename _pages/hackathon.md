title: "UCI ML Hackathon"
---

Today, artificial intelligence and machine learning are being widely used for all sorts of useful and critical discoveries and pattern recognition. Tracking economies, predicting natural disasters, and training robots are just some of the incredible and fascinating things that are being done with machine learning this very minute. In an age of extreme technological development, it only makes sense that our students grow their understanding with it.

This virtual hackathon aims to encourage direct student interaction with UCI’s machine learning repository. The goal of every participating member/team is to envision creative uses of available data sets and innovatively show how the final results can be used for social good. Regardless of the cause - environmental, ethical, or health - we hope that the final report that students draft will highlight something interesting about the data with which they become familiar. 

Successful teams may be encouraged to continue developing their project after the event jointly with UCI’s machine learning repository research team. Discoveries made from the Machine Learning Hackathon can be applied to other relevant datasets, or can spark a call for action on implementing a solution to an existing problem. All participants will create open source work, allowing other teams or researchers to further their initial progress.

Whether it be a simple, fascinating discovery or significant breakthrough, we are beyond excited to see what YOU can come up with!
