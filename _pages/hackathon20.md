## Dates

- ~~Registration closes: May 8, 2020~~
- **Hackathon: May 15 - May 24, 2020**
- Results announced: June 8, 2020

<!-- Eligibility: University of California, Irvine students of all degrees, majors, backgrounds, and interests are more than welcome to register! That being said, we highly recommend having some solid experience in machine learning in order to succeed in this event. -->

Check out the schedule of relevant events [here](/events/hackathon20/schedule).

## Description

Today, artificial intelligence and machine learning are being widely used for all sorts of useful and critical discoveries and pattern recognition. Tracking economies, predicting natural disasters, and training robots are just some of the incredible and fascinating things that are being done with machine learning this very minute. In an age of extreme technological development, it only makes sense that our students grow their understanding with it.

This virtual hackathon aims to encourage direct student involvement with contributed datasets from the UCI research community. The goal of every participating member/team is to use or develop machine learning approaches for the challenge datasets, in order to visualize, predict, clean/complete, analyze, or other such applications. Regardless of the domain - environmental, ethical, health, etc - we hope that the final submission that students draft will highlight something interesting about the data with which they become familiar. The most interesting submissions, as judged by experts in the challenge datasets, will receive monetary awards.

Successful teams may be encouraged to continue developing their project after the event jointly with UCIâ€™s machine learning repository research team. Discoveries made from the Machine Learning Hackathon can be applied to other relevant datasets, or can spark a call for action on implementing a solution to an existing problem. All participants will create open source work, allowing other teams or researchers to further their initial progress.

Whether it be a simple, fascinating discovery or significant breakthrough, we are beyond excited to see what YOU can come up with!

## Format

This hackathon will last a little over a week. In that time, students will work individually, or in teams up to four people in size, to use machine learning to produce some interpretation of the dataset that they choose to work with. This _does not_ have to be limited to programming a model aimed at achieving high accuracy. It can include, but is not limited to, creating visual representations of the data or improving its interpretability. Correspondence and announcements throughout the duration of the event will happen primarily through Slack. We will provide additional contact information there, if necessary. We will be arranging daily check-ins, meetings with dataset owners, and office hours, should anyone need guidance or assistance. There will be prizes offered to those groups that submit particularly useful or creative deliverables. We encourage students with any academic background or interest to participate!
